# Object-Detection-Using-YOLOV8

Develop a real-time photo object detection system using YOLOv8 in Python. Train the model on annotated datasets, evaluate its performance, and deploy it for object detection in photos. Optimize the model's efficiency using techniques like quantization and pruning. Gain hands-on experience with YOLOv8, Python, and computer vision. Apply your skills to automate object recognition tasks in various applications. Prior knowledge of Python and deep learning is recommended.
